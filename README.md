-------------------
These files are my first attempts at writing code.

In no particular order:

The `Huen's Method` evaluates a range of function values of a differential equation.

The `False Position Method` is a root finding function.

`LU Factorization` finds the lower/upper matrices of a square matrix.

The `Simpson's 1/3 Method` approximates the integral of a function. 
The trapezoidal rule is also used on the last interval if the number of inputs is even (Simpson's 1/3 rule can't handle that).
